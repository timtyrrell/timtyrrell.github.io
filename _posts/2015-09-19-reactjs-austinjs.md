title: React.js AustinJS Sept 2015 Presentation

---

Here are the slides from the React.js talk that I gave at [AustinJS](http://austinjavascript.com/posts/meetups/2015/09/15/) in September 2015. Most of the presentation was me "live coding" an inline-edit component. That source code is [here](https://github.com/timtyrrell/react-inline-edit-talk).
