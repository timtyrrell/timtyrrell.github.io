title: React.js Lightning Talk

---

Here is a "lightning talk" on React.js that I have at Austin on Rails in February of 2015. Sadly, there was way more content than the time allowed, but here they are:

<script async class="speakerdeck-embed" data-id="5be332cb29304ebabc49c012bbbab4d4" data-ratio="1.34031413612565" src="//speakerdeck.com/assets/embed.js"></script>
